  "commissionHeading": "10. Commission Structure",
  "commissionBody": "Schnell Logistics operates on a transparent commission-based model to ensure fair compensation for Drivers and sustainable operations for the platform.\n\n**10.1 Commission Rate**\n\n- **Standard Commission**: Schnell deducts a **7% commission** from the total fare of each completed delivery or service. This commission covers platform maintenance, customer support, and operational costs.\n- **Example**: If a delivery fare is 100 TND (Tunisian Dinar), Schnell deducts 7 TND as commission, and the Driver receives 93 TND.\n- **Transparency**: The commission is clearly displayed to Drivers before accepting a delivery request and in the transaction history within the App.\n\n**10.2 Additional Fees**\n\n- **Service Fees**: Customers may incur additional fees for premium services, such as express delivery or secure transport. These fees are disclosed during the booking process and do not affect the Driver’s commission.\n- **Taxes**: Applicable taxes (e.g., VAT, sales tax) are calculated and added to the fare based on local regulations. Taxes are separate from the commission and are clearly itemized in receipts.\n- **Surge Pricing**: During high-demand periods, fares may increase due to surge pricing. The 7% commission applies to the surged fare, increasing Driver earnings proportionally.\n\n**10.3 Payment Processing**\n\n- Customer payments are processed via in-office cash payments or mandat payments for account recharges, as online payments are not currently supported.\n- Driver payouts are processed weekly (every Monday) to the Driver’s registered bank account or digital wallet, after deducting the 7% commission and any applicable taxes.\n- Drivers can view their earnings, commission deductions, and payout schedules in the App’s “Earnings” section.\n\n**10.4 Disputes**\n\n- If a Customer disputes a charge, Schnell will investigate and may temporarily hold the Driver’s payout until the dispute is resolved.\n- Drivers will be notified of any disputes via email or in-app notifications and can provide evidence (e.g., delivery confirmation, photos) to support their case.\n- Resolved disputes in favor of the Driver will result in immediate payout, minus the standard 7% commission.",
  "cancellationHeading": "11. Cancellation Policy",
  "cancellationBody": "Schnell Logistics has a clear cancellation policy to ensure fairness for Customers, Drivers, and the platform. Cancellations are handled differently based on the party initiating the cancellation and the timing.\n\n**11.1 Customer Cancellations**\n\n- **Before Driver Acceptance**: Customers may cancel a service request at any time before a Driver accepts it, with no penalty or fee.\n- **After Driver Acceptance**: If a Customer cancels after a Driver has accepted the request but before pickup, a cancellation fee of 20% of the estimated fare (minimum 5 TND) may apply to compensate the Driver for time and fuel.\n- **After Pickup**: Cancellations after the Driver has picked up the package are not permitted unless the Driver agrees or there is a valid reason (e.g., unsafe conditions). A full fare may be charged.\n- **Process**: Customers can cancel via the App’s “Cancel Order” button or by contacting support@schnell.com. Refunds for cancellation fees are processed within 7 business days.\n- **Frequent Cancellations**: Customers who frequently cancel their shipments risk temporary restrictions or account suspension.\n\n**11.2 Driver Cancellations**\n\n- **Before Pickup**: Drivers may not cancel a request after acceptance unless they arrive at the pickup location and wait 12 minutes without the Customer appearing. In such cases, Drivers are free to cancel without penalty.\n- **After Pickup**: Drivers must complete the delivery unless there is a valid reason (e.g., safety concerns, Customer misconduct). Unauthorized cancellations after pickup may result in a penalty (e.g., 10 TND deduction from credits) and a lower performance rating.\n- **Process**: Drivers cancel via the App’s “Cancel Delivery” feature, and Customers are notified immediately with an option to rebook with another Driver.\n\n**11.3 Schnell-Initiated Cancellations**\n\n- **System Errors**: If a technical issue (e.g., server downtime, mapping errors) prevents service fulfillment, Schnell may cancel the request. Customers receive a full refund, and Drivers are not penalized.\n- **Policy Violations**: Schnell may cancel requests involving fraudulent activity, prohibited items (e.g., hazardous materials), or violations of our Terms of Use. Affected parties will be notified with details.\n- **Manual Cancellations**: Shipments accepted but not completed within 24 hours may be manually canceled by the admin, with penalties applied to both the Driver and Customer.\n- **Force Majeure**: Cancellations due to unforeseen events (e.g., natural disasters, government restrictions) are exempt from fees, and both parties are notified promptly.\n\n**11.4 Refunds**\n\n- Refunds for Customer cancellations are processed to the original payment method within 7 business days.\n- Drivers are not charged commissions for cancelled deliveries unless they are at fault (e.g., unauthorized cancellation after pickup).\n- Refund disputes can be escalated to support@schnell.com for review.\n\n**11.5 Notifications**\n\n- All cancellations trigger automatic notifications to affected parties via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.\n- Customers and Drivers can track cancellation history in the App’s “Order History” or “Earnings” sections.",
  "suspensionHeading": "12. Account Suspension and Termination",
  "suspensionBody": "Schnell Logistics reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts to ensure platform integrity, safety, and compliance with our Terms of Use.\n\n**12.1 Account Suspension**\n\n- **Reasons for Suspension**: Breaches of our Terms of Use, such as providing false information, engaging in harassment, or transporting prohibited items. Detected fraud, unauthorized access, or attempts to manipulate ratings or earnings. Requirements from law enforcement or regulatory bodies to suspend an account pending investigation. Drivers with consistently low ratings (below 3.0 out of 5.0 for 10 consecutive deliveries) or frequent cancellations may face suspension. Customers who frequently cancel their shipments risk temporary restrictions or account suspension.\n- **Process**: Suspended users receive an email and in-app notification detailing the reason, duration (e.g., 7 days, 30 days), and appeal instructions. During suspension, users cannot book or accept new services but can access their account to view history or submit appeals. Suspensions are reviewed regularly, and accounts may be reinstated upon resolution of the issue (e.g., payment clearance, policy compliance).\n\n**12.2 Account Termination**\n\n- **Reasons for Termination**: Engaging in deliberate fraud, such as falsifying delivery confirmations or payment details. Harassment, discrimination, or violence toward other users, Schnell staff, or third parties. Transporting illegal goods, violating transportation laws, or engaging in criminal conduct. Multiple suspensions without corrective action.\n- **Process**: Terminated users receive a detailed notice via email and in-app notification, unless prohibited by law (e.g., ongoing investigations). Upon termination, all scheduled deliveries are cancelled, and Customer refunds are processed within 7 business days. Drivers’ remaining credit balances (after commission deductions) are paid out within 30 days, subject to verification. Terminated accounts cannot be reactivated, but users may appeal for reconsideration.\n\n**12.3 Appeals Process**\n\n- Users may appeal suspensions or terminations within **14 days** of notification by emailing support@schnell.com or using the App’s “Appeal Decision” feature. Appeals must include the user’s name, account details, and any supporting evidence (e.g., delivery records, communication logs). Schnell will review appeals within 10 business days and provide a written response. Decisions are final but may be escalated to an independent mediator for Business Partners.\n\n**12.4 Performance Monitoring**\n\n- We monitor user performance to ensure quality and safety. Customers and Drivers receive ratings based on feedback from each other. Low performance (e.g., frequent cancellations, poor communication) may trigger warnings before suspension or termination. Users are notified of performance issues via email or in-app alerts and given 7 days to improve before further action.",
